DYNAMIC ARRAYS

Key Features:
- An unpacked array whose size can be decided at the run time.
- At the time of declaration, the array is empty.
- The array size is determined during the run time only, when it is allocated memory
using new constructor.
- Can be allocated and resized at the time of simulation.

Syntax:

int dyn_arr[]: // Declare Empty dynamic array

Methods:
1. new[]: allocate memory to array by specifying size
dyn_arr = new[7];
2. $size: Display size of the dynamic array
$size(dyn_arr);
3. Sdelete: delete the array
dyn_arr.delete;

Advantages:
- Efficient use of memory since you allocate the size as needed only during run time.
Applications:
- When you are not sure about the size of array until simulation.
