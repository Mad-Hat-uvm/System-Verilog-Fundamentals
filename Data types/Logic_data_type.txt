. Key Features:

'logic' data type

4 state variable (can take values: 0, 1, x, z).
can be driven both in procedural blocks 'initial' 'always' & continuous statements 'assign'.
should have only one driver.
last assignment wins behaviour in case of multiple assignment (which implies it has no hardware equivalence).

Difference between 'logic' & 'reg':
- reg can be driven only in procedural blocks like always & initial, logic can be driven in both procedural blocks &
continuous assign statements.

Difference between 'logic' & 'wire':
- net can be driven only in continuous assign statements; logic can be driven in both procedural blocks &
continuous assign statements.
- can have multiple drivers.

Difference between 'logic' & 'bit':
- logic is 4-state, bit is 2-state.
default value of logic is 'x', default value of bit is '0'.
