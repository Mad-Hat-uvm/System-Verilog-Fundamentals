Question: What is advantage of structure/union over arrays?
Answer: In case of array, all elements will have to be of one data type, but in case of structure or union, we can store elements of 
        different data types together.

Question: What is the fundamental difference between Union and structure?
Answer:   
      Memory Allocation:

Structure: Each member of a structure has its own memory location, so the total size of the structure is the sum of the sizes of all its members.
Union: All members of a union share the same memory location. The total size of the union is the size of its largest member because all members occupy the same space.
Accessing Members:

Structure: Each member of a structure can hold independent values at any time. Modifying one member does not affect the others.
Union: Only one member can hold a value at any given time. Writing to one member will overwrite the data in other members, as they share the same memory.
