Queues

- Size is dynamic, varies when you add/delete elements.
- Collection of homogeneous elements.
- Analogous to a one-dimensional unpacked array that grows and shrinks automatically.
- Syntax as unpacked arrays, but specify $ as the array size.
eg int q[5]//Unbounded Queue
- maximum size of a queue can be limited by specifying right bound (optional)
e-g int q[$:8]//Bounded Queue with max size of 8

Advantages:
- In-built methods for element sorting, searching, insertion, deletion, etc.

Queue methods:
int size();                         : No. of items in the queue
insert(int index, queue_type item); : Inserts the item at specified index
delete(int index);                  : Deletes the item at the specific index
queue_type pop_front();             : Removes and returns the first element of the queue
queue_type pop_back();              : Removes and returns the last element of the queue
push_front(queue_type item);        : Inserts the given element at the front of the queue
push_back(queue_type item);         : Inserts the given element at the end of the queue
