2-state variables in SV

Â· 2-state data types in SV:
bit
byte
int
shortint
longint

. ADVANTAGES
- Improved performance
- Improved memory usage

. CAUTION
- Signed 2-state variables in randomization can result in negative value.
If you define a byte variable, it's value ranges from -128 to +127 & not from 0 to 255.
Solution: You could use unsigned declaration to avoid this.
When a 4-state value is converted to a 2-state value, any 'x' or 'z' is converted to 0.
Verification engineers need to be careful while connecting the design outputs to 2-state variables because if
design drives 'x' or 'z', testbench may never know ---- design bug may be skipped due to this.
Solution: Connect design outputs to 4-state variable instead of 2-state.
