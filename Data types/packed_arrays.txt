PACKED ARRAYS IN SV
Key Features:

Dimensions are declared before the identifier name.

Guaranteed to be represented as a contiguous set of bits.

Packed arrays can only be made of the single bit types (bit, logic, reg, wire, and the other net types) or other packed arrays.

Data types with predefined widths cannot have packed array dimensions declared. These types are: byte, shortint, int, longint, and integer

If a packed array is declared as signed:
the array viewed as a single vector shall be signed.
ii. the individual elements of the array are unsigned unless declared as signed.
iii. part-select of a packed array shall be unsigned.

e.g. logic [3:0] [7:0] data_mem;

  76543210    76543210     76543210    76543210
 data_mem[3] data_mem[2]  data_mem[1]  data_mem[0]

 Advantages:
 Efficient use of memory.

OPERATIONS ON PACKED ARRAYS:
bit [7:0] A;

bit [7:0] B;

1. Array Size: $size(A)

2. Initialization: B = 8'b11111111;

3. Copy one array to another: A = B;
