/* Watchdog Timer Problem Statement
You have two signals:

start_transaction: goes high when a request starts

complete_transaction: goes high when it's done

If the completion does not happen within 5 cycles of start, you must raise an error. */

/* ðŸ§  Thinking Strategy
We need:

A counter that starts on start_transaction

A way to reset the counter on completion

A mechanism to detect timeout (when counter > 5) */
