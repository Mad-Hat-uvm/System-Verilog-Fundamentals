Static Variables 
Earlier we discussed that memory wasn't allocated for class variable until it is 
constructed but there is exception to this. 
SV behaves differently if we put a static keyword in front of a class's data member, 
then the memory for that variable gets allocated as soon as we define the class. 
Another aspect of static member is that we have only have one copy of them no matter how 
many times we instantiate the class to create new objects. All objects see the same 
copy of the member. 
class lion_cage; 
static Iibn cage[$]; 
endclass : lion_cage
