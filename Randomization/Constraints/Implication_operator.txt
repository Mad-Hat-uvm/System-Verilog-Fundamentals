Implication Constraints 
SV supports two implication operators:"->" and "if. 
Lets look at implication operator: "->". Suppose, 
constraint cl {A -> B;} 
How above implication operator works is:
If A is TRUE, B must be TRUE
If A is FALSE, B can be TRUE or FALSE
Lets looks example: 
class impCons; 
rand bit a, b; 
constraint c2 {(a==l) -> (b==1);}
endclass 
Possible values for a and b are: 
if a == 1, b == 1
if a == 0, b can be 0 or 1
The case "a = 1 and b = 0" will never occur.
