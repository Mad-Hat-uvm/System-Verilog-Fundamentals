Implication Constraints(Contd..) 
class impCons; 
rand bit a, b; 
constraint c2 { 
    (a == 1) -> (b == 1);
    (b == 0);
}
endclass 

Possible values are: 
If "a =1", then "b" must be "1", but there is another constraint so "a" cannot take value "1". 
If "a = O", b" can be "O" or "I", but other constraint says so in this case, "b" can take only "O" 
So, only possible values "a" and "b" can take in this example is: 
a = 0 and b=0.
