Turning ON and OFF, a constraint block

arg = 0 -> constraint is turned OFF.

arg = 1 -> constraint is turned ON.

How to use this is:

<handle_for_class> .< constraint_name>.constraint_mode(arg) : this will turn
OFF/ON the constraint.

<handle_for_class>.constraint_mode(arg) : this will turn OFF/ON all the
constraints in the class.
