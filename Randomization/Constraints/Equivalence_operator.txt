Equivalence Operator in Constraint block

Equivalence Operator(" <- >") is bi-directional.

rand bit a, b;

constraint c { (a == 1) <- > (b == 1);}

Possible values are:

If a is 1, then b must be 1.

If b is 1, then a must be 1.

This operator is bi-directional, constraining one values which fix the other value.

Similarly,

If a is 0, then b must be 0.

If b is 0, then a must be 0.
