Equivalence Operator in Constraint block(Contd .. )

Lets change the constraint as following:

rand bit a, b;

constraint c { a <- > b;}
This works as previous constraint since data type is bit of size 1.
Suppose, constraint change as following:

rand bit a, b;

constraint c {

a <- > b;

a == 1;

}

Then possible values are:
a=1 and b=1;

IMPORTANT: This will not be valid in case a and b are not 1 bit variables.
